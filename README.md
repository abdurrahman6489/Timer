### The details of the App are as follows.
1. User can pause the Timer any number of times.
2. The Timer can also be reset
3. The button which is pressed is turned to green colour
4. There is a progressIndicator bar and progress in percent.
5. It remains in green colour in normal,
6. If time goes beyond 80%, it turns to orange
7. If time goes beyond 90%, it turns to red
8. indicating that time remaining is less.
9. suppose if user gives 70 in the seconds input, then it automatically adjusts time, showing 1 in minute input and 10 in seconds. so the user does not have to calculate all the time conversions.
